Welcome to labelord!
=====================

Introduction
-------------

**Labelord** is a management application for your **GitHub** repositories, which allows you to do a lot of cool stuff - e.g. list all repositories/labels or add/delete/update multiple repositories **labels** - easily by using your own **CLI** or **Flask web interface**!

For more information, please check the sections below. I recommend you to start by `Why should I use labelord <general.html#section>`__ section, and then head over to `Installation <installation.html#section>`__.
